Sometimes, after you hit the Export button, it may seem as though nothing happens.
In that case, the file format dialog may be displayed behind GIMP - if so, simply select the dialog to bring it up.

Several users reported crashes on Windows and macOS when clicking on the menu entries.
If the crashes occur to you, try reinstalling GIMP.

The following file formats are not working properly with this plug-in:
* colored XHTML - does not save images at all.

The following file formats require displaying the file format dialog for each layer, not just the first layer:
* raw (works properly for GIMP 2.10 and above),
* FLI,
* C source,
* HTML.

On Windows, the following file formats do not work properly if file paths contain accented characters:
* DDS (works properly for GIMP 2.10.10 and above),
* OpenRaster,
* X PixMap Image.
