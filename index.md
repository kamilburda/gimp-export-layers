### What can Export Layers do?

* Export in any file format provided by GIMP and third-party plug-ins
* Batch edit layers
* Customize processing with procedures and constraints

**This plug-in is no longer maintained. For GIMP 3, you can use [Batcher](https://kamilburda.github.io/batcher/), which is also capable of batch image file conversion and exporting images opened in GIMP.**


### Getting started and need help?

See [Installation](sections/Installation.html) and [Usage](sections/Usage.html).


### Need more customization?

See [Customizing Export](sections/Customizing-Export.html).


### Need to edit layers without exporting them?

See [Batch Editing](sections/Batch-Editing.html).


### Curious about the latest changes?
